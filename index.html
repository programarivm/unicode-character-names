    <h3>What Is a Unicode Character?</h3>
    <p>
      Despite this rather unappealing name, Unicode is an IT standard that allows to encode any imaginable character that exists in
      this world. Ranging from extinct ancient scripts and symbols, to funny emoji, lovely emoticons, faces, ideograms, and cute animals.
      Unicode supports the character you're searching for. The standard has a total of about 143,000 characters, and
      each of which is supposed to have a name that allows searching.
