# Unicode Character Names

Search engine for emojis, special characters, emoticons, symbols and more funny things. Search by Unicode char name. To be used on social media: Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and many others.

This app provides with a JSON file named `unicode.json` containing Unicode characters and their names, which has been generated with [this PHP script](https://github.com/programarivm/unicode-ranges/blob/master/examples/ranges/04-all-names.php).

View the [demo](https://programarivm.github.io/unicode-character-names/).
